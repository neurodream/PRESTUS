- automatic transducer pos
- try to run Julians code
	V smoothing skull: load from file
	V not asking for overwriting
	attenuation values - a bit unclear: only valid for 500k?
		try values as they are right now, understand later...
	log shows errors
		trying with LD_lib_path now... seems to run through...
			but still unsupported symbol error
			likely because simnibs was copied to Julians folder
		alternative if this does not run: (github compare for differences, and then) just run with adjusted params in own repo
		quite some changes in single_sbj_pipeline as well - try to use Julians new one
		CAREFUL storage in M!!
	set all parameters correctly
		implement the optimization for the desired profile
			where are phases set??
- add position second transducer
- add transducer, standing waves
- explore protocols (esp. DC)

see ITK-snap: problem in adding second transducer: transforms like rotating and scaling need to be applied it seems; because
- in setup_source function the target and transd pos only differ in one dimension (z!!)
- % Rotate and scale the segmented T1 (tissue mask) to line up with the transducer's axis (in preprocess_brain function)


% Rotate and scale the segmented T1 (tissue mask) to line up with the transducer's axis

SART task:
- in MRI session?
	problem: maybe not everyone needs MRI session
	two flies with one stone: apply drift diffusion modeling?
	no baseline task?

write Martin for pilot number strategy
ask someone else


problems:
- if 2 transducers implemented in PRESTUS: 3 points (tr1, tr2, targ) - often no single image plane possible!

questions:
- consent form?? use the ethics template from DCC?
- other prep for tmw: any other angle optimization needed?
- light track of ECSW?
- alpha values optimized for 500k
- orthogonal transducers?
- LUTZ: desk?
- workgroup folder?

mention:
- traveling week from the 23rd, not reachable on Monday

not yet:
- visualization implemented in PRESTUS
- maybe: heating results (and if, then show in ITK snap)

PRESTUS wishlist:
- 
- multi-layer configs (e.g. one for study, and one on top: sbj) (maybe already implemented)
