IMASONIC_IGT_300-15473_100.0mm.csv is copy from: Imasonic_test_ISPPA_65mm.csv

then seems like expected distance should set to 65mm instead?

(Imasonic_test_ISPPA_50mm_reversed.csv was a test to quickly move the focus further away and see if it affects the effective depth.
but there seem to be errors with fitting, with the console log

Exiting: Maximum number of function evaluations has been exceeded
         - increase MaxFunEvals option.
         Current function value: 1.177562 

and then index error: "Find where the data last rises above half the max." (no data found apparently)

...but the test with the 50mm instead of 65 free water Isppa should suffice)
